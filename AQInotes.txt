wake up based on:
- AQI threshold
- AQI trend
- AQI forecast
- Pollution specifics
- Allergens
- Weather (can do real weather?)

JR use case: got ready for ride not realizing AQI was shit. Solution: setting an alarm that goes off if the AQI exceeds a threshold within a defined time period?

Add an alert?

AQI Threshold -> Alarm trigger

Wake me if:
<Drop-down 1- AQI, Allergy risk, Temperature, individual pollutants> is <drop down 2- above/below> <text box- value>
Add a condition

Once clicked, new blank line like above appears. "and" is appended to existing line.

each condition row can be swiped left to remove it.

dark mode

alarm clock icons on forecast chart

Show forecast after set time + repeat for alarm? Maybe in confirmation popup?
