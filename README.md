# AQI Alarm

A smart, conditional alarm application designed for cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who plan their daily activities around air quality.

## The Concept
Standard alarms wake you up regardless of the environment. **AQI Alarm** is different. It only sounds if the air quality index (AQI) meets your specific criteria.

> *“Wake me at 6:00 AM, but only if the AQI is below 100.”*

If the air quality is too poor for your scheduled morning ride, the alarm remains silent, allowing you to get the extra rest you need.

## Features
* **Conditional Alarms**: Create triggers that only activate when AQI thresholds (Above/Below) are met.
* **24-Hour Forecast**: A compact visual chart displaying predicted air quality for the day ahead.
* **Smart Timeline Markers**: Active alarms are displayed as icons directly on the forecast chart, perfectly aligned with their scheduled time.
* **Global Standards**: Supports dynamic calculations for US (EPA), CN (MEP), UK (DAQI), and IN (NAQI) standards.
* **Real-Time Data**: High-precision environmental data and geocoding powered by the Open-Meteo API.
